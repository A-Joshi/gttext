==Ground Truthing tool for Color Images with Text==


In the research of algorithms that extract text from color images a set of files with the exact location of the text is needed to avoid inefficient and tedious visual checks of the results.

This Ground Truth information saves enormous time and gives accuracy.
For this the gttext project helps to create fast and quality Ground Truthed data-sets from color text images. 

The basic level of work is at a pixel detection, making possible to group regions to form the glyph or even use a direct editing to get the choice.

Extracting text from complex color images can be done immediately just by selecting the region of the open, scanned or pasted image document.

This computer engineering project was the result of a degree requirement and it is offered to the open source community. <br/>
Under GNU License, this project is open to improvements and to accept developers that may want to give a positive change.


Enjoy.
