== Version List ==

===Update 1.1.2===

  *  Faster performance

Default !GetPixel() [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/keze95wt(VS.80).aspx [1]] of MFC is very slow [http://www.experts-exchange.com/Programming/System/Windows__Programming/MFC/Q_23756952.html [2]]
, so it has substituted
by a !GetPixelFast() that access directly to memory to get the color and having checked  forehand the limit cases. (+ extra check while debugging)


  *  New mode of region selection

The !FillFlood() [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill [3]] worked checking the color distance with neighbor pixel.
The mode of get distance from the clicking pixel proves useful when regions have
a predominant color different from the background (draw backs is it depends exactly where
you click, similar to !MagicWand TM Photoshop) 

  *  Higher scalability for up to 70MP

An overall of avoid refresh the whole file but in loading it the first time had made
the software possible to handle huge images, with only limit on your memory and a simply 8 bytes x (#)pixels comparisons.

  *  Compressed Ground Truth data definition

Information stored as runs (x,y,r) instead than single pixels (x,y)


===New Update 1.2.1===

  *  Improved pixel edition tool

Knowing that the execution of pointer movements captures is discrete makes difficult a continuity of the pixel drawing. To solve this a drawing from last point captured and the new one smooths the pen drawing tool, overall in high loaded cpu moments.
